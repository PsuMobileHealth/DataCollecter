Form.cs and Quaternion.cs are the C# files used (in conjunction with National Instruments libraries) to create the Windows
version of the Freescale Sensor Fusion Toolbox (which can be downloaded from http://www.freescale.com/sensorfusion).

fusion_toolbox_20140929.zip contains the full source code for the Android version of the toolbox.  That tool can be downloaded
from Google Play at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freescale.sensors.sfusion.

We're not actively soliciting new code for the Android toolbox, which is why you see it as a zip file rather than as a full
GitHub subdirectory.  But the code is available here, possibly to be used to seed a future, more generic, effort.  These files
utilize the same BSD license used for the embedded sensor fusion library.
